# Splendr
I worked on this project in the third semester of my studies at HTW Berlin. It was meant to teach the basics of the MVC pattern. 
The framework used is a modified version of SimpleMVC (nowadays known as [Nova-Framework](https://github.com/nova-framework/framework))


The excercise can be found here: https://beier.f4.htw-berlin.de/aufgaben/php-mvc/  
A live version can be found here: https://studi.f4.htw-berlin.de/~s0544210/Splendr2/
